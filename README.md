# Introduction :
MiNet is a Swedish network-based Hardware Store that is getting more and more
popular since we offer high quality on our products with relatively low prices. At
the moment we are opening physical stores in Stockholm, Gothenburg and
Malm√∂. As we are expanding explosively, we need to have a Warehouse
Management System to organize and structure our inventory, and we hope you
can help us develop that system. Our development manager has designed the
test so that it will give us a better sense of your skills as a developer and what
approaches and work methodologies you do use to solve problems and prioritize
requirements without providing you with detailed instruction.
